## Getting Started With the Project

> This project is written in a local style, meaning that I have not set it up on any domain. If you would like to run this project, download the files, and set them them up inside a new, empty directory. Make sure that all of the files are in the same folder (including the *"content"* directory), while making sure that the content directory still has all of its images within it. Once all the files are set up, open up the *"index.html"* file located in the main directory in a web browser (this is achieved by either right clicking the file and launching with a certain web browser, or opening up a web browser page and dragging the file into it). Doing this will display the project's main web page.

### Changing Image Filter Speed

The speed at which the images are looped through is by default set to 15 seconds. Located in the file *"main.js"*, there is a variable called: 
```let changesPerThirtySeconds = 2;```
> This variable states the changes every thirty seconds; in this case, the images will change twice every thirty seconds (15 seconds).

If one wanted to change the filter rate, all they would have to do is change this variable's value to the amount of times one would want the images to filter within 30 seconds. After the variable is changed, all one would need to do is save the script (**ctrl-s** on windows, **cmd-s** on macs), and reload the page.
