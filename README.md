# Assignment #9: Superstars

**This assignment is a collection of "Superstars" displayed on a website.**

## Getting Started With the Project

> This project is written in a local style, meaning that I have not set it up on any domain. If you would like to run this project, I would recommend opening up the *"index.html"* file located in the main directory in a browsing window. Doing this will display the project's main web page.

### Changing Image Filter Speed

The speed at which the images are looped through is by default set to 15 seconds. Located in the file *"main.js"*, there is a variable called: 
```let changesPerThirtySeconds = 2;```
> This variable states the changes every thirty seconds; in this case, the images will change twice every thirty seconds (15 seconds).

If one wanted to change the filter rate, all they would have to do is change this variable's value to the amount of times one would want the images to filter within 30 seconds. After the variable is changed, all one would need to do is save the script (**ctrl-s** on windows, **cmd-s** on macs), and reload the page.
