## Getting Started With the Project

> ### Changing Image Filter Speed

The speed at which the images are looped through is by default set to 15 seconds. Located in the file *"main.js"*, there is a variable called: 
```let changesPerThirtySeconds = 2;```
> This variable states the changes every thirty seconds; in this case, the images will change twice every thirty seconds (15 seconds).

If one wanted to change the filter rate, all they would have to do is change this variable's value to the amount of times one would want the images to filter within 30 seconds. After the variable is changed, all one would need to do is save the script (**ctrl-s** on windows, **cmd-s** on macs), and reload the page.
